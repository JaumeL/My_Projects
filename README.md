### DataCamp Projects

This is my personal collection of completed DataCamp Projects which give me hands-on experience solving real-world problems and data fluency as well as helping me to build up my projectâ€™s portfolio.

All these projects are based on Python and cover different topics such as import & cleaning data, data manipulation & visualisation, probability & statistics, among others.  

I am constantly completing DataCamp courses, I have a career track in Data Analyst with Python. I am also completing different DataCamp projects starting from raw data and ending in interesting insights.
